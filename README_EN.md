**What developers need to know**

After you get the tool, you will need to sign the ipa or use Trollstore to install it to your device, so you can open the app.

**Supported development environments**

Compatible with all development environments you currently use.
Currently, the debugserver perfectly supports the debugging of additional processes (you do not need to do anything.)

**Environment repair**

If your environment is damaged, you can restart your phone, turn on the "rebuild jailbreak rnvironment" switch, and then turn on the jailbreak.

If there is a Sileo 522 error, try to repair the sileo language. If it's invalid for you, try to restore the phone settings.

**What developers need to prepare**

Configure the complete ssh port 22
Configure SSH password free root password on the console (default: alpine) 
Unable to repair password temporarily
ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/id_ rsa. Pub root @ your ip

**Precautions**

The current test version only supports 15.0-15.1.1 A12-A15-M1. 
Rootless jailbreak supports some tweaks. Some unsupported tweaks need to be updated by the plug-in author to support rootless environments. This version integrates Sileo, TrollStore, ssh, libsubstitute, Libhooker, Procursus, Bigboss, etc.

If your storage in iCloud is full, the permanent signature will become invalid after the space is restarted. It may also lead to some other problems. The current cause is unknown (to be fixed.)

There's no need to change the theos or change anything, but what you may need to change is the relevant path in your code (the path in the deb package does not need to be changed, and nothing needs to be changed)

Full support for make install
Full support for make uninstalll
Full support for make do

For the normal use and installation of iOSOpendev, no changes are required.

Compile the log. 
During the compilation process, the console will display the current log. Please ignore it.
If the console displays as follows:
ldid: Unknown header magic
Are you sure that is a Mach-O?
ldid: operator(): No such file or directory
make uninstall
make installl

**Guardian Directory**

/var/jb/Library/LaunchDaemons

**Please check other directories**

**About my daemons**
